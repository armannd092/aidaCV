                My name is Aida. I am a fresh pharmacy graduate. I received my Pharm.D degree after 6 consecutive years in 2018. 
                When I was student, I have attended some extracurricular courses, particularly international public health summer school, which gave me an insight into many areas of public health. Finally, in the last year of studies, I have carried out my dissertation on novel pharmaceutical delivery systems, particularly sustained release formulation. My results have been awarded the third best presentation in the Iranian Pharmacy Student Seminar held yearly among all faculty of pharmacy in Iran.
                Ever since I graduated, I found my research interest in biomedicine and translational medicine. I have gained incredible skills in translational research and novel systems medicine. During working as a community pharmacist, I realized that the incidence of NAFLD is rising in our country, alarmingly. Hence, I have accomplished a project to find hidden mechanisms in the disease progression of Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, and the results are going to be published as paper publication. Last year my abstract was granted a silver admission fee for presentation in the 4th USERN Congress in Budapest, Hungary.
                Here I am sharing my experience and internship and which skills I obtained from each before and after graduation period. To make it more accessible I cluster them into following scopes.
